# Enterprise Architect Tools
Diagram Generation Tool (DGT) &amp; Tabular Documentation Tool (TDT)'

The tool reads a UML Class Model from an EA Project (EAP), generates package-based diagrams given the information stored in the EAP, and then stores those diagrams into the EAP.  The actual content of the UML Class Model (e.g., names, tagged-values) is completely immaterial.
